# Review of *"Identification of Move Method Refactoring Opportunities"*

In this paper, the authors (N. Tsantalis and A. Chatzigeorgiou) define several metrics for the purpose of identifying *move method* opportunities.

## Definition of Distance

For each attribute, method, and class in the system, the authors define an entity set.

- The entity set of an attribute contains all methods that access it.
- The entity set of a method contains all methods and attributes that it accesses.
- The entity set of a class is all attributes and methods contained within.

An entity may be considered "accessed" if it is either directly accessed or if it is accessed via a getter, setter, or delegate. A method is considered a getter, setter, or delegate if it purely passes its responsibilities to another entity. There may be many layers of indirection where a delegate calls another delegate which calls another delegate, etc.

The following entities are not considered and are not added to any entity sets:

- Methods that are purely getters, setters, or delegates*
- Attributes that are of any type that is defined elsewhere in the same system
- Static attributes and methods
- Anything that is not defined in the same system (e.g. methods defined in an external library)

*However, the attribute or method that these methods point to are added to entity sets when appropriate.

The authors then define a distance metric between an arbitrary entity and a class. Let $S_x$ be the entity set of an entity $x$. The distance between some entity $e$ and some class $C$ is
$$
\text{distance}(e,C) = 1 - \frac{|S_e \cap S'_C|}{|S_e \cup S'_C|}
\quad\text{where}\quad
S'_C = S_C \setminus \{e\}.
$$

### Criticisms

**Entities are equally weighted.** The use of Jaccard distance ignores valuable information. Consider an example. The method $m_1$ exclusively uses attribute $a_1$ which is contained in class $C$. Similarly, method $m_2$ exclusively uses attribute $a_2$ which is also contained in class $C$. Then unsurprisingly, $\text{distance}(m_1,C) = \text{distance}(m_2,C)$. However, what if attribute $a_1$ was exclusively used by $m_1$ while $a_2$ was used by many more methods besides $m_2$? Then we would want $\text{distance}(m_1,C) \ll \text{distance}(m_2,C)$ because $a_1$ and $m_1$ are more important to one another than $a_2$ and $m_2$ are. However, this is not the case in the proposed metric.

**Attributes of a system type are ignored.** The authors state that "attributes that are references to classes of the system are not considered as entities nor added to the entity sets of other entities since such references are essentially a pipeline to the state or behavior of another class." It is not obvious that this should be the case. If it is useful, there needs to be more justification.

**Getters, setters, and delegates may be hard to identify.** How much additional code could be added to one of these methods before it stops being a getter, setter, or delegate? For instance, the authors allow the getters and setters of collections to do more than just get or set. This seems arbitrary. Instead, maybe we could include all methods on a "delegate spectrum" based on how much they act like a delegate. The more processing a method does, besides accessing dependent methods and attributes, the less of a delegate it is. Another option is to not give any special treatment to these kinds of methods.
