# Research Notes

These are my own research notes. I edit in VSCode. VSCode has pretty good markdown support but it can be improved further with extensions. The two I use are [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) and [GitHub Markdown Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.github-markdown-preview). [Markdown Preview Enhanced](
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) also looks good but I haven't tried it much. [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) and [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) also come in useful.
